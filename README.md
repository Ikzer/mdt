# World of Darkness Logsheets

Being a roleplayer for quite a few years now, and playing mainly World of Darkness games like Vampire, Werewolf, Mage, etc. I came with the necessity to log my play sessions and characters. Later, as a Game Master I needed to plan my game sessions and chronicles, and give the players all kinds of information. While for games like Dungeons & Dragons are lots of tools and apps to aide the GMs and players, for WoD there aren't so I decided to make mine, starting with a web application and we'll see if after that a mobile app is a possibility.
